Open the current browser tab in a private window, with the possibility of temporary profiles. The latter is only supported in Chromium-based browsers and acts as if you were opening them for the first time without changing a single setting.

Invoke the Workflow with `ic`, and it will open a new incognito window with your current tab. ⌘↵ will also close the tab in your current window. ⌥↵ opens the current tab in a new Chromium-browser instance, and ⌃↵ also closes the tab in the current window.
