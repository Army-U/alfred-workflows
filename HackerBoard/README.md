Action any link to open it in the background in your default web browser. Action it with ⌃ to copy it to the clipboard. If listing Hacker News links, actioning with ⌥ will open the comments thread (set the `hn_main` Workflow Environment Variable to `comments` to invert this behaviour).

Lists are updated automatically and cached. To force the lists to update, run `:hackerboardforceupdatelists`.
