Quick reference for different standard paper formats and resolution sizes of different devices.

For paper sizes, type `paper`, and you’ll see the available standards; all of them have different shortcuts which you can narrow down by starting to type the name of the format you want (so typing `paperiso b3` will only show you the B3 size of the ISO 126 standard).

For device resolutions, type `resolution`, and you’ll see the available devices. You can narrow them down by name.
