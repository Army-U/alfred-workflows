Output info from videos from [a plethora of video sources](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html), even when embedded in other pages.

Copy a link to your clipboard, run `vidur` and pick your verbosity level. It’ll output the video’s link with its duration and optionally its title and description.
